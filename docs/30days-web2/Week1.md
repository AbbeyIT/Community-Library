# Day3

Hello folks! Today we are building! This is a start of a series of projects that we will be building in this challenge. Once you have completed your build, you can push it to GitHub and share your repo with us. 

For our first build, we will start with building a **Javascript Quiz Game**. Since everyone here has different levels of familiarity with web development, it would be interesting to see what you build. Please build a quiz game with at least two questions. At the minimum, the question type will be MCQ. 

For beginners, you might want to complete the Javascript campaign on the StackUp platform first, then refer to this tutorial where you will be building a MCQ quiz that gives the score upon pressing a button: https://bit.ly/js-quiz-build  .

For more experienced web developers, the challenge is for you to create a more advanced quiz game. Some suggestions would be to accept fill in the blank answers that utilises regex, or create a MCQ quiz with a timer. 

# Day4
Hello, I hope you've had the time to start your Quiz builds! Today we will be reading about the **history of Javascript** and its development.

As usual, feel free to comment on what other folks share!

# Day 6

Hello, hope you guys are doing fine in this pathway of 30 Days of Web 2. Today's the third day since we started building our multiple choice quiz game. If you've completed it, do remember to share with us. Otherwise, the weekend is a pretty good time to build if you have the time. 

Two days ago, you read about the long history of Javascript. In fact, did you know Javascript was created in 1995, and is now 27 years old! A number of scripting languages have popped up along the way, but Javascript continues to remain popular. Why is that? Read today's article to understand why Javascript will likely remain a popular language.

Once you're done reading, here are some questions that you can think about:

- Do you think Javascript is the scripting language of the future? Or are there other languages that are strong competitors? 
- For those who picked up Javascript, why did you do so? 
- How's your experience with Javascript so far?

Feel free to answer the above questions...
