# Stackie Identity

## What is the stackie identity to you!

- **What makes you a Stackie**

FAVOUR
   
- Being a Stackie is like being a complete student to me learning things I can'tlearn from my school alone. hmm as a developer i would say an improved developer.

Athirah

- To describe myself, I would say that I like challenge, and learn from it. I make a lot of mistakes and I take tea for calming my mind again and continue back.

Raghav

- Interested in learning new tech by helping and learning through community.

Kodyvim

- Curiosity to learn and grow most especially the community.

- **What makes a Stackie different from other developers out there.**

Whoami??

- On what makes Stackies different from other developers, I'd say the community. I mean, we're still at the early stages and our actions and inactions are what's shaping the community. Glad to have been a part of the community at this early stage.

- **If you were to choose one word to describe yourself as a Stackie, what would it be?**

Nid! - Learner

- Always learning new things

Cylee - Learner too!
- Looking to learn
- Algorand a good example

Rahublatz
- Curiosity, The curiosity of not knowing what I'm gonna learn next?

AstroDude
- One good skill stack up teaches is ‘attention to detail’. Makes me more careful even in other things I do.

such fee paid by buyers of such services to air more campaign... It's going to be a win
win situation - Zionnaire

# How to better facilitate Question asking?

We notice how people are beginning to ask question not in the best way possible, how do you
think as a community we can make the help seeking process better?

Cos I don't want ppl to be rude and for our Stackies to feel like oh I'm obligated to help

- make the bot put the messages on how to ask good questions - Nid!
- Gohar's Guide - one'll have to mention the quest, campaign and then the problem, and the bot will create a threat for it Hmm, there was this server I was in. where we used
to have a channel "Find Study Partner" we just put our request there and then the bot makes a thread for us and the thread closes after some time of inactivity - AstroDude

This is the Lofi-Radio server
and, see how there are options of what problem one have
a combination of something like this and getting a thread related to the doubt/problem
would be great ig and other stackies can help/answer the problem in that thread which
can be closed after sometime of inactivity one can select an option and proceed like this.
