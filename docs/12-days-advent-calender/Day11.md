## Day 11 - Special Safe Space Channel

Dear @Stackies , thank you for hanging around these past few days! 💌  Now that we've created a repository of reference material via the forum channel, we've made you something special as well 💝  :happy: . This is for everybody, and as a special something in order to encourage our @I'm shy but want to interact more! and @I'm not shy and I'd love to make friends with our shyer Stackies! , here's our 🥰｜safe-space  channel! This is for our Stackies who have:

Read through and internalised all the material we've put out for the past 10 days :celebrate: ,
Who want to put these skills into practice :coffee~1: ,
Are willing to facilitate and be facilitated gently! 😉 

We know some of you may be a bit intimidated by the speed of 💬｜general-chat , so here's a channel specifically for you to get to know each other in a slower-paced, more structured space :dance: . Don't fret! Your CMs and your mods are right here to help you along! Come on in ❤️
