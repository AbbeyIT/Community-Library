## Day 7 - Creating your own identity card!

Hello we have an extremely fun activity for you today! We are going to be creating our very own identity cards! This would bring us one step closer to understanding ourselves better! Also, this would be a great way for us to share with others a little more about ourselves in a quick and easy manner!  

You can begin by visiting the website 🖱️ 

🪪 [Carrd](https://carrd.co/build)

When you are there, pick a template you like and create a profile describing yourself! You can include some of the content we went through in previous weeks including, what is unique about yourself and your strengths and weaknesses etc. 

‼️However, do take note of the following when creating your profiles ! 

Do not put in your personal information on Carrd! 🫣
You can use your name and an avatar as your photo to ensure that we can recognise your profile easily! 😶‍🌫️
Be creative about it ! 🖌️

Once you are satisfied with your profile, post the link to your carrd in the comments below! You will be enrolled in our mini-competition - vote for your favourite carrds by reacting to the links (you can react to as many as you like!) At the end of the week, the top 3 most voted will gain 5000 Stackcoins each! 🪙 

Looking forward to seeing your Carrds!
