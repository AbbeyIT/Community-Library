Let's try an exercise together! Here's a template you can adapt for your personality and other aspects of your life. Of course, do adapt it to suit your personality and context!:

### Template 1: 

(Intro) hi, my name is: _____

(Information that allows people to potentially identify themselves as sharing the same characteristics as you) I am from ____, I am a _____, (add more I'd you'd like) and I would love to get to know you better especially if we share common interests like (list)

(Polite call-to-action) please reply to my response if you like ____, and please tell me what you like about ____! I hope to find common ground with you!

### Template 2:

For the shy and introverts:

(Intro) hi, my name is: _____

(Information that allows people to potentially identify themselves as sharing the same characteristics as you) I am from ____, I am a _____, (add more I'd you'd like). I hope to meet others who are like (list)!

(Context setting) I am a bit shy, and I would love to be communicated with in ____ manner. (This gives people an idea of how to approach you in a way you are comfortable with!) I (describe a little of how people can know you are comfortable, eg. "You'll know I'm more comfortable when I become more expressive in the way I chat!")

(Polite call-to-action) please reply if we can make friends/start a conversation/etc

It would be lovely if you can make a new friend or two!
